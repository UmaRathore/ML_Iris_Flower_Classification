# **Iris Flower Cassification - Machine Learning Project** #

## Description: ##

Problem statement: classifying Iris flower species from its features.



Iris features: Sepal, Petal, lengths, and widths

This is a classification project, since the variable to be predicted is categorical (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).The goal here is to model the probabilities of class membership, conditioned on the flower features.

## Dataset : ##
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under five attributes - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species.
Imported from sklearn library

## Libraries: ## 
```
1. Sklearn
2. Numpy
3. Math
4. Matplotlib
5. Pandas
6. Seaborn
```
## Machine Learning Steps: ##
```
1. Data gathering
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Splitting
4. Data Model Selection
5. Data Analysis
6. Improvement
```
